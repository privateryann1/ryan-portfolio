## About

I have been developing in Garry's Mod for a few years now, whether it's server creation, coding, mapping, ect. It's one of my hobbies and I enjoy learning new things everyday and challenging myself.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on in the past:

### Faction Selector

A simple, clean menu that pops-up when a user loads into the server. It allows the user to choose which side they would like to join.
