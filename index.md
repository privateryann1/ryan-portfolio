## About

I have been developing in Garry's Mod for a few years now, whether it's server creation, coding, mapping, ect. It's one of my hobbies and I enjoy learning new things everyday and challenging myself.

You can contact me on [gmodstore](https://www.gmodstore.com/users/privateryan), [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/BigRVman/), and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/328348902732595210).

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on in the past:

### Faction Selector

A simple, clean menu that pops-up when a user loads into the server. It allows the user to choose which side they would like to join.

### Weapon Dealer/Shop NPC
![Shop NPC Gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/privateryann1/ryan-portfolio/master/gifs/shopnpc.gif)
A shop that is built into an NPC. This can support any type of entity so it doesn't have to only be guns. You can also easily add custom functions as well.

### Anti-Prop Kill/Spam

I created this system in order to stop users from prop-killing and crashing the server by colliding a bunch of props together.

### Prop Whitelist

I made this so I wouldn't have to blacklist a huge amount of props using FPP, that way you can just whitelist a few if you aren't allowing a lot of props anyways.

### Entity Spawn Notification
![Ent Spawn Notify](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/privateryann1/ryan-portfolio/master/gifs/spawnnotify.gif)
I created this in order to deter staff members from abusing their powers. The chat message is sent out to staff members with the rank defined in the configuration file.

### Friendly-Fire Toggle
![Friendly-Fire](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/privateryann1/ryan-portfolio/master/gifs/friendlyfire.gif)
I created this to negate the amount of team-killing that was going on. The cooldown between each use was put in to disallow abuse of the command.

### Leaderboard
![Leaderboard](https://i.imgur.com/buYlR4c.png)
This is a clean, simplistic menu that shows the top 3 people of each defined category: Kills, Deaths, KDR, and Money.
