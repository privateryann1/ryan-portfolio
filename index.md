## About

I have been developing in Garry's Mod for a few years now, whether it's server creation, coding, mapping, ect. It's one of my hobbies and I enjoy learning new things everyday and challenging myself.

You can contact me on [gmodstore](https://www.gmodstore.com/users/privateryan), [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/BigRVman/), and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/328348902732595210).

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

### Questing System

A questing system that allows the user to easily create quests with little to no Lua knowledge.

### Point Capture System
![Capture Picture](https://i.imgur.com/gB4u2a8.jpg)
This is a standard system where you stand on the point and it starts to capture for your team. This project is still work-in-progress.

### Ticket System

This is a system that turns the standard '@' admin message into a ticket. Staff members can accept tickets, and it has quick access for SteamID, bring, goto, and return using the actions button.

### ClonewarsRP "AI"

This is a system that allows you to open any door through commands. It has a registering system so you can name the doors, and it uses file-saving, meaning it will persist through server restarts. 

### Jail Command
![Jail Gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/privateryann1/ryan-portfolio/master/gifs/jailcommand.gif)
This is a custom ULX command that improves the default jail from ULX. This strips the target, teleports them to your defined room, and keeps them there for a specified amount of time. The target cannot switch jobs, spawn props, and suicide to get out. If they reconnect to the server, they will still be jailed. Also includes commands to add jail positions in-game. (Also supports SAM admin mod)

### Faction Selector
![Faction Selector Gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/privateryann1/ryan-portfolio/master/gifs/factionselector.gif)
A simple, clean menu that pops-up when a user loads into the server. It allows the user to choose which side they would like to join.

### Leaderboard
![Leaderboard](https://i.imgur.com/buYlR4c.png)                                                     
This is a clean, simplistic menu that shows the top 3 people of each defined category: Kills, Deaths, KDR, and Money.

### Weapon Dealer/Shop NPC
![Shop NPC Gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/privateryann1/ryan-portfolio/master/gifs/shopnpc.gif)
A shop that is built into an NPC. This can support any type of entity so it doesn't have to only be guns. You can also easily add custom functions as well.

### Anti-Prop Kill/Spam
![Anti-Prop Spam](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/privateryann1/ryan-portfolio/master/gifs/anti-prop-kill.gif)
I created this system in order to stop users from prop-killing and crashing the server by colliding a bunch of props together.

### Prop Whitelist
![Prop Whitelist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/privateryann1/ryan-portfolio/master/gifs/propwhitelist.gif)
I made this so I wouldn't have to blacklist a huge amount of props using FPP, that way you can just whitelist a few if you aren't allowing a lot of props anyways.

### Entity Spawn Notification
![Ent Spawn Notify](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/privateryann1/ryan-portfolio/master/gifs/spawnnotify.gif)
I created this in order to deter staff members from abusing their powers. The chat message is sent out to staff members with the rank defined in the configuration file.

### Friendly-Fire Toggle
![Friendly-Fire](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/privateryann1/ryan-portfolio/master/gifs/friendlyfire.gif)
I created this to negate the amount of team-killing that was going on. The cooldown between each use was put in to disallow abuse of the command.
